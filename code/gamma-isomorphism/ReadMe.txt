The program dependence graphs for the C-programs are generated using the frama-c tool. The dot file generated by frama-C was parsed to create the graph data structure.
Command for generating dot files:
frama-c -pdg -pdg-dot test <c-filename> 

The dot files generated are passed as command line arguments to the Graph_isomorphism_check1 java file

Folder testfiles2 contains some sample testcases and their corresponding dot files that can be used to run the application.

jgrapht folder contains the jar files for jgrapht library

Import the folder as eclipse project as follows:
Import->select existing projects->give the path to this folder

1. Right click on project folder
2. Go to build path->configure build path
3. Click on libraries path
4. Click on add external jar files and add jgrapht jar files.
